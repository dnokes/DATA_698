  abstract = "Time series clustering has been shown effective in providing
              useful information in various domains. There seems to be an
              increased interest in time series clustering as part of the
              effort in temporal data mining research. To provide an overview,
              this paper surveys and summarizes previous works that
              investigated the clustering of time series data in various
              application domains. The basics of time series clustering are
              presented, including general-purpose clustering algorithms
              commonly used in time series clustering studies, the criteria for
              evaluating the performance of the clustering results, and the
              measures to determine the similarity/dissimilarity between two
              time series being compared, either in the forms of raw data,
              extracted features, or some model parameters. The past researchs
              are organized into three groups depending upon whether they work
              directly with the raw data either in the time or frequency
              domain, indirectly with features extracted from the raw data, or
              indirectly with models built from the raw data. The uniqueness
              and limitation of previous research are discussed and several
              possible topics for future research are identified. Moreover, the
              areas that time series clustering have been applied to are also
              summarized, including the sources of data used. It is hoped that
              this review will serve as the steppingstone for those interested
              in advancing this area of research.",

                adding controls to reduce exposure during periods of poor

   abstract = "Abstract Many applied problems require a covariance matrix
               estimator that is not only invertible, but also well-conditioned
               (that is, inverting it does not amplify estimation error). For
               large-dimensional covariance matrices, the usual estimator---the
               sample covariance matrix---is typically not well-conditioned and
               may not even be invertible. This paper introduces an estimator
               that is both well-conditioned and more accurate than the sample
               covariance matrix asymptotically. This estimator is
               distribution-free and has a simple explicit formula that is easy
               to compute and interpret. It is the asymptotically optimal convex
               linear combination of the sample covariance matrix with the
               identity matrix. Optimality is meant with respect to a quadratic
               loss function, asymptotically as the number of observations and

               stock returns by an optimally weighted average of two existing
               estimators: the sample covariance matrix and single-index
               covariance matrix. This method is generally known as shrinkage,
               and it is standard in decision theory and in empirical Bayesian
               statistics. Our shrinkage estimator can be seen as a way to
               account for extra-market covariance without having to specify an
               arbitrary multifactor structure. For NYSE and AMEX stock returns
               from 1972 to 1995, it can be used to select portfolios with
               significantly lower out-of-sample variance than a set of existing
               estimators, including multifactor models.",

               generalize the concept of the minimum spanning tree (MST) by
               introducing a family of q-dependent minimum spanning trees
               (qMSTs) that are selective to cross-correlations between
               different fluctuation amplitudes and different time scales of
               multivariate data. They inherit this ability directly from the
               coefficients $\rho$\_\{q\}, which are processed here to construct
               a distance matrix being the input to the MST-constructing
               Kruskal's algorithm. The conventional MST with detrending
               corresponds in this context to q=2. In order to illustrate their
               performance, we apply the qMSTs to sample empirical data from the
               American stock market and discuss the results. We show that the
               qMST graphs can complement $\rho$\_\{q\} in disentangling
               ``hidden'' correlations that cannot be observed in the MST graphs
               based on $\rho$\_\{DCCA\}, and therefore, they can be useful in
               many areas where the multivariate cross-correlations are of
               interest. As an example, we apply this method to empirical data
               from the stock market and show that by constructing the qMSTs for
               a spectrum of q values we obtain more information about the
               correlation structure of the data than by using q=2 only. More
               specifically, we show that two sets of signals that differ from
               each other statistically can give comparable trees for q=2, while
               only by using the trees for q$\neq$2 do we become able to
               distinguish between these sets. We also show that a family of
               qMSTs for a range of q expresses the diversity of correlations in
               a manner resembling the multifractal analysis, where one computes
               a spectrum of the generalized fractal dimensions, the generalized
               Hurst exponents, or the multifractal singularity spectra: the
               more diverse the correlations are, the more variable the tree
               topology is for different q's. As regards the correlation
               structure of the stock market, our analysis exhibits that the
               stocks belonging to the same or similar industrial sectors are
               correlated via the fluctuations of moderate amplitudes, while the
               largest fluctuations often happen to synchronize in those stocks
               that do not necessarily belong to the same industry.",

   abstract = "Abstract This review covers recent results concerning the
               estimation of large covariance matrices using tools from Random
               Matrix Theory (RMT). We introduce several RMT methods and
               analytical techniques, such as the Replica formalism and Free
               Probability, with an emphasis on the Mar{\v c}enko--Pastur
               equation that provides information on the resolvent of
               multiplicatively corrupted noisy matrices. Special care is
               devoted to the statistics of the eigenvectors of the empirical
               correlation matrix, which turn out to be crucial for many
               applications. We show in particular how these results can be used
               to build consistent ``Rotationally Invariant'' estimators (RIE)
               for large correlation matrices when there is no prior on the
               structure of the underlying process. The last part of this review
               is dedicated to some real-world applications within financial
               markets as a case in point. We establish empirically the efficacy
               of the RIE framework, which is found to be superior in this case
               to all previously proposed methods. The case of additively
               (rather than multiplicatively) corrupted noisy matrices is also
               dealt with in a special Appendix. Several open problems and

               the statistics of the eigenvalues lambda(i) of C against a ``null
               hypothesis''--a random correlation matrix constructed from
               mutually uncorrelated time series. We find that a majority of the
               eigenvalues of C fall within the RMT bounds [lambda(-),lambda(+)]

               shows distinct groups, whose identities correspond to

abstract = { We propose a dynamic model for the high/low range of asset prices within fixed time intervals: the Conditional Autoregressive Range Model (henceforth CARR). The evolution of the conditional range is specified in a fashion similar to the conditional variance models as in GARCH and is very similar to the Autoregressive Conditional Duration (ACD) model of Engle and Russell (1998). Extreme value theories imply that the range is an efficient estimator of the local volatility, e.g., Parkinson (1980). Hence, CARR can be viewed as a model of volatility. Out-of-sample volatility forecasts using the S&P500 index data show that the CARR model does provide sharper volatility estimates compared with a standard GARCH model.},

               desire for parsimonious models of economic phenomena that take
               human reasoning into account. This approach has been the
               cornerstone of modern economic theory. We explain why this is
               so, extolling the virtues of equilibrium theory; then we present
               a critique and describe why this approach is inherently limited,
               and why economics needs to move in new directions if it is to
               continue to make progress. We stress that this shouldn't be a
               question of dogma, and should be resolved empirically. There are
               situations where equilibrium models provide useful predictions
               and there are situations where they can never provide useful
               predictions. There are also many situations where the jury is
               still out, i.e., where so far they fail to provide a good
               description of the world, but where proper extensions might
               change this. Our goal is to convince the skeptics that
               equilibrium models can be useful, but also to make traditional
               economists more aware of the limitations of equilibrium models.
               We sketch some alternative approaches and discuss why they
               should play an important role in future research in economics.

               ordinary people from all walks of life and train them to be
               extraordinary traders in just two weeks. Only nineteen years old

               trading strategies that enabled them to earn an average return
               of over 80 percent per year and profits of more than $100

               approximate stationarity is usually determined by careful, but
               mostly informal, analysis of the differenced series. For many
               time series, some differencing seems appropriate, but taking the
               first or the second difference may be too strong. As an
               alternative, Hosking, and Granger and Joyeux proposed the use of
               fractional differences. For \$-\frac\{1\}\{2\} , the resulting
               fractional ARIMA processes are stationary. For \$0 , the
               correlations are not summable. The parameter d can be estimated,
               for instance by maximum likelihood. Unfortunately, estimation
               methods known so far have been restricted to the stationary
               range \$-\frac\{1\}\{2\} . In this paper, we show how any real

               stationarity, follow immediately. The resulting confidence
               intervals for the ARIMA parameters take into account the
               additional uncertainty due to estimation of d. A simple
               algorithm for calculating the estimate of d and the ARMA

               One technique that has been known for a long time, although it
               is less commonly used, involves not just daily closing prices,
               but the daily high and low. This actually introduces quite a bit
               more information into the calculation, since the high and low
               are functions of the entire intraday price path for the
               underlying, not just the price at a single point in time. In
               contrast, models that allow volatility to vary over time,
               notably GARCH, have become popular as a way to capture
               time-variation in the volatility process. This article
               introduces a GARCH-type Multiplicative Error Model (MEM) for the
               daily price range. Like other GARCH specifications, the MEM can
               be modified to accommodate different densities for the
               stochastic shocks, different orders of dependence on past shocks
               and volatilities, and even fractional integration to produce a
               long-memory process. The authors fit the model to the daily
               price ranges for the CHF/USD and USD/GBP exchange rates and show
               it to be quite effective in producing accurate (and profitable)

   abstract  = "Simulation has proved to be a valuable tool for estimating
                security prices for which simple closed form solutions do not
                exist. In this paper we present two direct methods, a pathwise
                method and a likelihood ratio method, for estimating derivatives
                of security prices using simulation. With the direct methods,
                the information from a single simulation can be used to estimate
                multiple derivatives along with a security's price. The main
                advantage of the direct methods over resimulation is increased
                computational speed. Another advantage is that the direct
                methods give unbiased estimates of derivatives, whereas the
                estimates obtained by resimulation are biased. Computational
                results are given for both direct methods, and comparisons are
                made to the standard method of resimulation to estimate
                derivatives. The methods are illustrated for a path independent
                model (European options), a path dependent model (Asian
                options), and a model with multiple state variables (options
                with stochastic volatility).",

                combinations of options, the formula and the analysis that led
                to it are also applicable to corporate liabilities such as
                common stock, corporate bonds, and warrants. In particular, the
                formula can be used to derive the discount that should be

                    temporal clustering, is a challenging problem in machine
                    learning. Here we propose a novel algorithm, Deep Temporal
                    Clustering (DTC), to naturally integrate dimensionality
                    reduction and temporal clustering into a single end-to-end
                    learning framework, fully unsupervised. The algorithm
                    utilizes an autoencoder for temporal dimensionality
                    reduction and a novel temporal clustering layer for cluster
                    assignment. Then it jointly optimizes the clustering
                    objective and the dimensionality reduction objec tive. Based
                    on requirement and application, the temporal clustering
                    layer can be customized with any temporal similarity metric.
                    Several similarity metrics and state-of-the-art algorithms
                    are considered and compared. To gain insight into temporal
                    features that the network has learned for its clustering, we
                    apply a visualization method that generates a region of
                    interest heatmap for the time series. The viability of the
                    algorithm is demonstrated using time series data from
                    diverse domains, ranging from earthquakes to spacecraft
                    sensor data. In each case, we show that the proposed
                    algorithm outperforms traditional methods. The superior
                    performance is attributed to the fully integrated temporal
                    dimensionality reduction and clustering criterion.",
