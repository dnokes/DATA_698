                asset allocation (GTAA) strategies across a broad range of asset

                similar assets, this topic has received little attention in the
                existing literature. The main finding documented in this article
                is that momentum and value strategies applied to GTAA across 12
                asset classes deliver statistically and economically significant
                abnormal returns. For a long top-quartile and short
                bottom-quartile portfolio based on a combination of momentum and
                value signals, the authors report a return of 12\% per annum
                over the 1986--2007 period. Performance is stable over time, is
                also present in an out-of-sample period, and is sufficiently
                high to overcome transaction costs in practice. The return
                cannot be explained by potential structural biases toward asset
                classes with high risk premiums, nor by the Fama--French and
                Carhart hedge factors. The authors argue that financial markets
                may be macroinefficient due to insufficient ``smart money''

                (spencer.martin\{at\}asu.edu) Here are some practical
                perspectives on momentum investing in stocks internationally.
                Momentum is generally more profitable on the long side than on
                the short side, making it accessible to a broad range of
                institutional capital, and both price and earnings momentum
                profits are significant globally. Earnings momentum
                internationally is distinct from price momentum; using price and
                earnings momentum in conjunction produces greater economic
                profits. Momentum profits co--move more weakly across markets
                than market indexes. Interestingly, while market correlations
                are much higher in down markets than in up markets, momentum
                correlations are low under both market conditions. There is no
                appreciable difference in momentum strategy profitability in up
                and down markets, which means timing is less important to
                momentum traders. Finally, momentum strategies are not riskless?
                there are often periods of several months when they have netted
                low or negative returns. The findings altogether suggest that
                momentum is useful in international portfolio management, but it
                should be implemented very thoughtfully.",

                traditional asset classes. Further, time-series momentum has
                performed well in 8 out of 10 of the largest crisis periods over

                with maintained theories of asset-pricing behavior. They
                indicate either market inefficiency (profit opportunities) or
                inadequacies in the underlying asset-pricing model. After they
                are documented and analyzed in the academic literature,
                anomalies often seem to disappear, reverse, or attenuate. This
                raises the question of whether profit opportunities existed in
                the past, but have since been arbitraged away, or whether the
                anomalies were simply statistical aberrations that attracted the
                attention of academics and practitioners. One of the interesting
                findings from the empirical work in this chapter is that many of
                the well-known anomalies in the finance literature do not hold
                up in different sample periods. In particular, the size effect
                and the value effect seem to have disappeared after the papers
                that highlighted them were published. At about the same time,
                practitioners began investment vehicles that implemented the
                strategies implied by the academic papers. The weekend effect
                and the dividend yield effect also seem to have lost their
                predictive power after the papers that made them famous were
                published. In these cases, however, I am not aware of any
                practitioners who have tried to use these anomalies as a major
                basis of their investment strategy. The small-firm
                turn-of-the-year effect became weaker in the years after it was
                first documented in the academic literature, although there is
                some evidence that it still exists. Interestingly, however, it
                does not seem to exist in the portfolio returns of practitioners
                who focus on small-capitalization firms. Likewise, the evidence
                that stock market returns are predictable using variables such
                as dividend yields or inflation is much weaker in the periods
                after the papers that documented these findings were published.
                All of these findings raise the possibility that anomalies are
                more apparent than real. The notoriety associated with the
                findings of unusual evidence tempts authors to further
                investigate puzzling anomalies and later to try to explain them.
                But even if the anomalies existed in the sample period in which
                they were first identified, the activities of practitioners who
                implement strategies to take advantage of anomalous behavior can
                cause the anomalies to disappear (as research findings cause the
                market to become more efficient).",

               This strategy offers substantial improvement in risk-adjusted
               performance compared to buy-and-hold portfolios and a superior
               method of asset allocation than risk parity. We believe the
               discipline of trend following overcomes many of the behavioural
               biases investors succumb to, such as regret and herding, and
               offers a solution to the inappropriate sequence of returns which
               can be problematic for decumulation portfolios. The other side of
               behavioural biases is that they may be exploited by investors: an
               example is momentum investing where herding leads to continuation
               of returns and has been identified across many assets. Momentum
               and trend following differ as the former is a relative concept
               and the latter absolute. Combining both can achieve the higher
               return levels associated with momentum portfolios with much
               reduced volatility and drawdowns due to trend following. Measures
               based on utility of a representative investor reinforce the
               superiority of combining trend following with momentum
               strategies. These techniques help address the sequencing of
               returns issue which can be a serious issue for financial

                (guo\{at\}cats.ucsc.edu) The article introduces Passive Momentum
                Asset Allocation as an innovative approach to investment policy.
                Passive Momentum Asset Allocation (PMAA) harnesses momentum with
                an inexpensive and rational method for identifying both positive
                and negative momentum. Combined with the inherent superiority of
                asset class indexing, PMAA produces portfolio returns that
                outperform most, if not all, generally accepted equity market
                benchmarks. The authors show that there is strong persistence in
                asset class index returns, and PMAA is a method to invest in
                existing asset class indexes according to size and value
                factors. PMAA enables investors to enhance investor returns and
                to lower uncompensated risk in portfolios using this
                methodology. Furthermore, the authors show that there are limits
                to the benefits of diversification. Arbitrarily adding asset
                classes to a portfolio lowers return and increases uncompensated
                risk. Finally, they compare the PMAA strategy with two major
                commonly used asset allocation policies, buy and hold and
                constant mix strategies.",

               This is achieved by building topologically embedded networks
               containing the subset of most significant links and analyzing the
               network structure. For a planar embedding, this method provides
               both the intra-cluster hierarchy, which describes the way
               clusters are composed, and the inter-cluster hierarchy which
               describes how clusters gather together. We discuss performance,

               several artificial data-sets, finding that it can outperform

               among stocks traded in a stock market? Can a correlation analysis
               provide an answer to this question? In the past, correlation
               based networks have been proposed as a tool to uncover the
               underlying backbone of the market. Correlation based networks
               represent the stocks and their relationships, which are then
               investigated using different network theory methodologies. Here
               we introduce a new concept to tackle the above question--the
               partial correlation network. Partial correlation is a measure of
               how the correlation between two variables, e.g., stock returns,
               is affected by a third variable. By using it we define a proxy of
               stock influence, which is then used to construct partial
               correlation networks. The empirical part of this study is
               performed on a specific financial system, namely the set of 300
               highly capitalized stocks traded at the New York Stock Exchange,
               in the time period 2001-2003. By constructing the partial
               correlation network, unlike the case of standard correlation
               based networks, we find that stocks belonging to the financial
               sector and, in particular, to the investment services sub-sector,
               are the most influential stocks affecting the correlation profile
               of the system. Using a moving window analysis, we find that the
               strong influence of the financial stocks is conserved across time
               for the investigated trading period. Our findings shed a new
               light on the underlying mechanisms and driving forces controlling
               the correlation profile observed in a financial market.",

               mainly of the study of correlation-based hierarchical networks.
               This is somewhat surprising as the underlying assumptions of
               research looking at financial markets are that they are complex
               systems and thus behave in a nonlinear manner, which is confirmed

               and dependencies into hierarchical networks to study financial
               markets using mutual information and its dynamical extension: the

               different market sectors, a factor that exacerbates the level of
               systemic risk. We measure this systemic risk of three major world
               shipping markets, (i) the new ship market, (ii) the second-hand
               ship market, and (iii) the freight market, as well as the
               shipping stock market. Based on correlation networks during three
               time periods, that prior to the financial crisis, during the
               crisis, and after the crisis, minimal spanning trees (MSTs) and

               different market sectors tend to be more closely linked during
               financial crisis. Brownian distance correlation and Granger
               causality test both can be used to explore the directional
               interconnectedness of market sectors, while Brownian distance
               correlation captures more dependent relationships, which are not
               observed in the Granger causality test. These two measures can
               also identify and quantify market regression periods, implying

                extracts topological relations between the networks nodes (when

                step towards inference of causal activity relations between the

                information on the structure of the network. Here, we present a
                review of the new approach, and an example of its application to

                negligible in efficient markets. With the advance of technology,
                however, markets have become more sophisticated. To determine
                whether this has resulted in an improved market efficiency, we
                investigate whether statistically significant lagged correlation
                relationships exist in financial markets. We introduce a
                numerical method to statistically validate links in
                correlation-based networks, and employ our method to study
                lagged correlation networks of equity returns in financial
                markets. Crucially, our statistical validation of lead-lag
                relationships accounts for multiple hypothesis testing over all
                stock pairs. In an analysis of intraday transaction data from
                the periods 2002?2003 and 2011?2012, we find a striking growth
                in the networks as we increase the frequency with which we
                sample returns. We compute how the number of validated links and
                the magnitude of correlations change with increasing sampling
                frequency, and compare the results between the two data-sets.
                Finally, we compare topological properties of the directed
                correlation-based networks from the two periods using the
                in-degree and out-degree distributions and an analysis of

               Therefore, optimal portfolios overweight low-central securities
               to avoid the large variances that result when highly influential
               stocks are included in the investor's opportunity set. Next, we

               highly central nodes tend to coincide with older, larger-cap,
               cheaper and financially riskier securities. Finally, we explore

                    a ubiquitous task of fundamental importance in analyzing
                    market efficiency, portfolio allocation, and containment of
                    financial contagions. Recent attempts have shown that
                    representing such systems as a weighted graph characterizing
                    the complex web of interacting agents over some information
                    flow (e.g., debt, stock returns, shareholder ownership) may
                    provide certain keen insights. Here, we show that fragility,
                    or the ability of system to be prone to failures in the face
                    of random perturbations, is negatively correlated with
                    geometric notion of Ricci curvature. The key ingredient
                    relating fragility and curvature is entropy. As a proof of
                    concept, we examine returns from a set of stocks comprising
                    the S\&P 500 over a 15 year span to show that financial
                    crashes are more robust compared to normal ``business as

               probabilistic models. This method makes use of information
               filtering networks to produce a robust estimate of the global
               sparse inverse covariance from a simple sum of local inverse
               covariances computed on small subparts of the network. Being
               based on local and low-dimensional inversions, this method is
               computationally very efficient and statistically robust, even for

               and short time series. Applied to financial data our method
               results are computationally more efficient than state-of-the-art
               methodologies such as Glasso producing, in a fraction of the
               computation time, models that can have equivalent or better
               performances but with a sparser inference structure. We also
               discuss performances with sparse factor models where we notice
               that relative performances decrease with the number of factors.
               The local nature of this approach allows us to perform
               computations in parallel and provides a tool for dynamical
               adaptation by partial updating when the properties of some
               variables change without the need of recomputing the whole model.
               This makes this approach particularly suitable to handle big data
               sets with large numbers of variables. Examples of practical
               application for forecasting, stress testing, and risk allocation

   abstract = "We report significant relations between past changes in the
               market correlation structure and future changes in the market
               volatility. This relation is made evident by using a measure of
               ``correlation structure persistence'' on correlation-based
               information filtering networks that quantifies the rate of change
               of the market dependence structure. We also measured changes in
               the correlation structure by means of a ``metacorrelation'' that
               measures a lagged correlation between correlation matrices
               computed over different time windows. Both methods show a deep
               interplay between past changes in correlation structure and
               future changes in volatility and we demonstrate they can
               anticipate market risk variations and this can be used to better
               forecast portfolio risk. Notably, these methods overcome the
               curse of dimensionality that limits the applicability of
               traditional econometric tools to portfolios made of a large
               number of assets. We report on forecasting performances and
               statistical significance of both methods for two different equity
               datasets. We also identify an optimal region of parameters in
               terms of True Positive and False Positive trade-off, through a
               ROC curve analysis. We find that this forecasting method is
               robust and it outperforms logistic regression predictors based on
               past volatility only. Moreover the temporal analysis indicates
               that methods based on correlation structural persistence are able
               to adapt to abrupt changes in the market, such as financial
               crises, more rapidly than methods based on past volatility.",

               30 trading days, is presented. This allows clear identification
               of a nontrivial time-dependence of the resulting correlations. In
               addition, as a rule, the drawdowns are always accompanied by a

                    Several similarity metrics and state-of-the-art algorithms

                investments. As a result of the deterministic nature of such
                strategies, it is possible to determine their exact responses to
                any conceivable set of market conditions. Consequently,
                sensitivity analysis can be conducted to systematically uncover
                undesirable strategy behavior and enhance strategy robustness by
                adding controls to reduce exposure during periods of poor
                performance/unfavorable market conditions, or to increase
                exposure during periods of strong performance/favorable market
                conditions. In this study, we formulate both a simple systematic
                trend-following strategy (i.e., trading model) to simulate
                investment decisions and a market model to simulate the
                evolution of instrument prices. We then map the relationship
                between market model parameters under various conditions and
                strategy performance. We focus, in particular, on identifying
                the performance impact of changes in both serial dependence in
                price variability and changes in the trend. The long-range
                serial dependence of the true range worsens performance of the
                simple classic trend-following strategy. During periods of
                strong performance, the dispersion of trading outcomes increases
                significantly as long-range serial dependence increases.",

   author    = "Merton, Robert C",
   abstract  = "[The long history of the theory of option pricing began in 1900
                when the French mathematician Louis Bachelier deduced an option
                pricing formula based on the assumption that stock prices follow
                a Brownian motion with zero drift. Since that time, numerous
                researchers have contributed to the theory. The present paper
                begins by deducing a set of restrictions on option pricing
                formulas from the assumption that investors prefer more to less.
                These restrictions are necessary conditions for a formula to be
                consistent with a rational pricing theory. Attention is given to
                the problems created when dividends are paid on the underlying
                common stock and when the terms of the option contract can be
                changed explicitly by a change in exercise price or implicitly
                by a shift in the investment or capital structure policy of the
                firm. Since the deduced restrictions are not sufficient to
                uniquely determine an option pricing formula, additional
                assumptions are introduced to examine and extend the seminal
                Black-Scholes theory of option pricing. Explicit formulas for
                pricing both call and put options as well as for warrants and
                the new ``down-and-out'' option are derived. The effects of
                dividends and call provisions on the warrant price are examined.
                The possibilities for further extension of the theory to the
                pricing of corporate liabilities are discussed.]",

               desire for parsimonious models of economic phenomena that take
               human reasoning into account. This approach has been the
               cornerstone of modern economic theory. We explain why this is
               so, extolling the virtues of equilibrium theory; then we present
               a critique and describe why this approach is inherently limited,
               and why economics needs to move in new directions if it is to
               continue to make progress. We stress that this shouldn't be a
               question of dogma, and should be resolved empirically. There are
               situations where equilibrium models provide useful predictions
               and there are situations where they can never provide useful
               predictions. There are also many situations where the jury is
               still out, i.e., where so far they fail to provide a good
               description of the world, but where proper extensions might
               change this. Our goal is to convince the skeptics that
               equilibrium models can be useful, but also to make traditional
               economists more aware of the limitations of equilibrium models.
               We sketch some alternative approaches and discuss why they
               should play an important role in future research in economics.

               returns of 422 US stocks for the 35-yr period 1962-1996. We test
               the statistics of the eigenvalues lambda(i) of C against a ``null
               hypothesis''--a random correlation matrix constructed from
               mutually uncorrelated time series. We find that a majority of the
               eigenvalues of C fall within the RMT bounds [lambda(-),lambda(+)]

               shows distinct groups, whose identities correspond to
               conventionally identified business sectors. Finally, we discuss

   abstract  = "Cluster Analysis for Applications deals with methods and various
                applications of cluster analysis. Topics covered range from
                variables and scales to measures of association among variables
                and among data units. Conceptual problems in cluster analysis
                are discussed, along with hierarchical and non-hierarchical
                clustering methods. The necessary elements of data analysis,
                statistics, cluster analysis, and computer implementation are
                integrated vertically to cover the complete path from raw data
                to a finished analysis.Comprised of 10 chapters, this book
                begins with an introduction to the subject of cluster analysis
                and its uses as well as category sorting problems and the need
                for cluster analysis algorithms. The next three chapters give a
                detailed account of variables and association measures, with
                emphasis on strategies for dealing with problems containing
                variables of mixed types. Subsequent chapters focus on the
                central techniques of cluster analysis with particular reference
                to computational considerations; interpretation of clustering
                results; and techniques and strategies for making the most
                effective use of cluster analysis. The final chapter suggests an
                approach for the evaluation of alternative clustering methods.
                The presentation is capped with a complete set of implementing
                computer programs listed in the Appendices to make the use of
                cluster analysis as painless and free of mechanical error as is
                possible.This monograph is intended for students and workers who
                have encountered the notion of cluster analysis.",

               a time-dependent return correlation matrix in a moving window.
               First, we compare the normalized maximum eigenvalue time series
               of the market-adjusted return correlation matrix to that of the
               logarithmic return correlation matrix on an 18-year dataset of
               310 S\&P 500-listed stocks for small and large window or memory
               sizes. We observe that the resulting new eigenvalue time series
               is more stationary than the time series obtained without the
               adjustment. Second, we perform this analysis while sweeping the
               window size $\tau$$\in$\{5,…,100\}$\cup$\{500\} in order to
               examine the dependence on the choice of window size. This
               approach demonstrates the multi-modality of the eigenvalue
               distributions. We find that the three dimensional distribution of
               the eigenvalue time series for our market-adjusted return is
               significantly more stationary than that produced by classic
               method. Finally, our model offers an approximate polarization
               domain characterized by a smooth L-shaped strip. The polarization
               with large amplitude is revealed, while there is persistence in
               agreement of individual stock returns' movement with market with
               small amplitude most of the time.",

                similar to the dynamic asset tree studied recently, as both are
                based on correlations between asset returns. However, the new
                modified methodology does not, in general, lead to a tree but a
                disconnected graph. The asset tree, due to the minimum spanning
                tree criterion, is forced to ``accept'' edge lengths that are
                far less optimal (longer) than the asset graph, thus resulting
                in higher overall length for the tree. The same criterion also
                causes asset trees to be more fragile in structure when measured
                by the single-step survival ratio. Over longer time periods, in
                the beginning the asset graph decays more slowly than the asset
                tree, but in the long run the situation is reversed. The vertex
                degree distributions indicate that the possible scale free
                behavior of the asset graph is not as evident as it is in the
